# Little Shop of Orders, v2
BE Mod 2 Week 4/5 Group Project

## Background and Description

"Little Shop of Orders" is a fictitious e-commerce platform where users can register to place items into a shopping cart and 'check out'. Merchant users can mark their items as 'fulfilled'; the last merchant to mark items in an order as 'fulfilled' will automatically set the order status to "shipped". Each user role will have access to some or all CRUD functionality for application models.

Students will be put into 3 or 4 person groups to complete the project.

## Learning Goals
